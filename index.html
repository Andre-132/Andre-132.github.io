        Hi, my name is Andre Albarado. I am attending a software engineering
        boot camp at the University of Lafayette, with goals to become a
        fullstack developer! Ever since I was young computers fascinated me, and
        when I found software engineering I knew this was the career path for
        me. I love to problem solve and display my thought processes and ideas
        with others. I hope to strive in this field and become what I dream to
        be!
